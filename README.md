========

http://newsmap.bbcnewslabs.co.uk

Origionally created at #newsHACK by the BBC News Labs team.

The latest version of this hack uses D3 for map visualization to display headlines from around the world from a select range of sources in the BBC News Labs Juicer.

For more information see http://bbcnewslabs.co.uk or follow @BBC_News_Labs on Twitter.

NB: This hack uses bower to manage dependancies. If hacking on this, be sure to run `bower update` after checking out the repo!
